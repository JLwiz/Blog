                        The creation of CSS files provide alot of functionality and formatting for html files,
                    and are a core actor in webpage development. Through some experimenting and practice, the 
                    CSS language provides a plethora of features important to any webpage - such as: color coding elements,
                    margin sizing, and even gradiant color generation. Overall, the CSS files and 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.ASP">syntax</a> for webpage customization
                    are easy to follow - much easier than html. To start of with using CSS to apply different formats to standard html, 
                    you must first select the html element(s) that you wish to apply some format to. Once the element is selected, 
                    by specifying with curly brackets afterwards (Element{}), properties may be applied to within the brackets to
                    manipulate the formatting of the html. The property that is selected is followed by a colon and then a modifying value,
                    as can be shown in the example below.

                        CSS code can be quick to make the html code look cluttered. To maintain some readability of html, it is
                    more beneficial to link a .css file for general formatting. This is done through the 
                    <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">link</a></code> element. 
                    By specifying the relationship to the stylesheet 
                    (<code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_rel.asp">rel="stylesheet"</a></code>), and the hypertext reference 
                    (<code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp">href="docName.css"</a></code>), this can be overcome.
                    Though the use of external style sheets provide a lot of flexability in how CSS affects the html code; CSS stylesheets
                    still can have draw backs. External style sheets can also cause the load speed of the connected webserver to slow due to the 
                    increase in download times for due to the added file.

                    <h2>Linking JS and a Clock Script</h2>

                    Javascript is an object-oriented language that implements interactive elements into a web page.
                    To link javascript into an html file, you must first implement a <code>&ltscript&gt&ltscript/&gt</code> tag;
                    unlike css styleguides, as discussed in the last post, a source must be declared within the <code>&ltscript&gt</code> part of the script tag.
                    This declaration is done by specifying the source then the file name like so:
                </p>  
                    <div class = "codeBox">
                        <p>
                            <code class = "center"><b>&ltscript src="scriptname.js"&gt&ltscript/&gt</b></code>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                <p>
                    To get started on writing the first javascript file for this web page is not all that difficult.
                    In order to create a variable in javascript you must first declare the type <code>var</code> - javascript
                    will interpret the variable type based of what the assignment is. Javascript uses functions to process calls from html files,
                    which allow for verbose scripting calls. To get the time, you must first create a new
                    a new function, in which, you next can create a <code>Date</code> object (that is built into the javascript library) with the <code>new</code> modifier. Next, call the <code>.getHours(), .getMinutes(), and .getSeconds()</code> 
                    functions on the <code>Date</code> object by assigning them new variables. Once that is done, you need to specify that you want the javascript
                    to process the request based of the id of a tag in within the document which is calling the function as seen below.

                    <h2>Color Theory and Web Design</h2>

                    Color, though a basic aspect of a website, can be one of the most important aspects to any
                    website. By learning more about color theory, it can be used to create more dynamic and
                    cohesive color palettes to be used in designing a website. Colors have a wide range of values
                    for an expansive vocabulary of representations and combinations to explore and play with.
                    Though their is a plethora of possible color combinations, there is four main schools of thought in
                    the creating harmony with colors. With an analogous color layout colors next to eachother in the color
                    wheel are used to create a relatively monotoned, but harmonious, scheen with a predominant color theme.
                    Complementary color schemes offer stark contrast of opposing colors on the color wheel in which they vibrantly
                    oppose one another. Complementary colors, though having high contrast to one another,typically do not create
                    a cohesive aesthetic due to the opposing values and contrasts of the composed palette. Monochromatic schemes
                    provide familiar palettes from page to page; however, that familiarity also provides the draw back of possibly
                    making the web page to feel bland and monotonous - completely opposite to what is provided from complementary colors.
                    For a more balanced color scheme, a triadic scheme uses three colors on the wheel to create a diverse and harmonious
                    composition of colors.

                    Complementary color schemes provide vibrancy and heavy contrast; however, that vibrancy and contrast can create a massive 
                    draw back. Think of the common example of complementary, red and green, these colors together provide such a contrast that 
                    they rarely, if ever, look pleasing in combination to each other. However, vibrancy and contrast together can provide 
                    a clean and appealing combination; for example, Amazon.com's log uses contrast in a way that creates harmony with only two
                    colors. Using the dark black and vibrant yellow creates a memorable logo that does not strain the eyes. If a website has low
                    readability due to the color combinations used, it is not that far fetched that users may be more incline to quickly leave the 
                    page and go else where.
