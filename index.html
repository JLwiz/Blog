                <h2>CSS Syntax and External Stylesheets</h2>
                <p>
                        The creation of CSS files provide alot of functionality and formatting for html files,
                    and are a core actor in webpage development. Through some experimenting and practice, the 
                    CSS language provides a plethora of features important to any webpage - such as: color coding elements,
                    margin sizing, and even gradiant color generation. Overall, the CSS files and 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.ASP">syntax</a> for webpage customization
                    are easy to follow - much easier than html. To start of with using CSS to apply different formats to standard html, 
                    you must first select the html element(s) that you wish to apply some format to. Once the element is selected, 
                    by specifying with curly brackets afterwards (Element{}), properties may be applied to within the brackets to
                    manipulate the formatting of the html. The property that is selected is followed by a colon and then a modifying value,
                    as can be shown in the example below.

                <p>
                        CSS code can be quick to make the html code look cluttered. To maintain some readability of html, it is
                    more beneficial to link a .css file for general formatting. This is done through the 
                    <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">link</a></code> element. 
                    By specifying the relationship to the stylesheet 
                    (<code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_rel.asp">rel="stylesheet"</a></code>), and the hypertext reference 
                    (<code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp">href="docName.css</a></code>), this can be overcome.
                    Though the use of external style sheets provide a lot of flexability in how CSS affects the html code; CSS stylesheets
                    still can have draw backs. External style sheets can also cause the load speed of the connected webserver to slow due to the 
                    increase in download times for due to the added file.
