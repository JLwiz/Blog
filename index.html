                        The creation of CSS files provide alot of functionality and formatting for html files,
                    and are a core actor in webpage development. Through some experimenting and practice, the 
                    CSS language provides a plethora of features important to any webpage - such as: color coding elements,
                    margin sizing, and even gradiant color generation. Overall, the CSS files and 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.ASP">syntax</a> for webpage customization
                    are easy to follow - much easier than html. To start of with using CSS to apply different formats to standard html, 
                    you must first select the html element(s) that you wish to apply some format to. Once the element is selected, 
                    by specifying with curly brackets afterwards (Element{}), properties may be applied to within the brackets to
                    manipulate the formatting of the html. The property that is selected is followed by a colon and then a modifying value,
                    as can be shown in the example below.

                        CSS code can be quick to make the html code look cluttered. To maintain some readability of html, it is
                    more beneficial to link a .css file for general formatting. This is done through the 
                    <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">link</a></code> element. 
                    By specifying the relationship to the stylesheet 
                    (<code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_rel.asp">rel="stylesheet"</a></code>), and the hypertext reference 
                    (<code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp">href="docName.css"</a></code>), this can be overcome.
                    Though the use of external style sheets provide a lot of flexability in how CSS affects the html code; CSS stylesheets
                    still can have draw backs. External style sheets can also cause the load speed of the connected webserver to slow due to the 
                    increase in download times for due to the added file.

                    <h2>Linking JS and a Clock Script</h2>
                    <h3 class ="date">09/09/2021</h3>

                    Javascript is an object-oriented language that implements interactive elements into a web page.
                    To link javascript into an html file, you must first implement a <code>&ltscript&gt&ltscript/&gt</code> tag;
                    unlike css styleguides, as discussed in the last post, a source must be declared within the <code>&ltscript&gt</code> part of the script tag.
                    This declaration is done by specifying the source then the file name like so:
                </p>  
                    <div class = "codeBox">
                        <p>
                            <code class = "center"><b>&ltscript src="scriptname.js"&gt&ltscript/&gt</b></code>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                <p>
                    To get started on writing the first javascript file for this web page is not all that difficult.
                    In order to create a variable in javascript you must first declare the type <code>var</code> - javascript
                    will interpret the variable type based of what the assignment is. Javascript uses functions to process calls from html files,
                    which allow for verbose scripting calls. To get the time, you must first create a new
                    a new function, in which, you next can create a <code>Date</code> object (that is built into the javascript library) with the <code>new</code> modifier. Next, call the <code>.getHours(), .getMinutes(), and .getSeconds()</code> 
                    functions on the <code>Date</code> object by assigning them new variables. Once that is done, you need to specify that you want the javascript
                    to process the request based of the id of a tag in within the document which is calling the function as seen below.
                </p>
                <img class = "center" src = "images/clockExample.PNG"></img>
                <script src = "clockScript.js"></script>
                <div style = "margin: 20px;">
                    <button class = "center" type = "button" onclick="getTime()";>Show Time</button>
                </div>
                <div id = "clockDisplay" class="displayBox">
                    <!-- <p id = "clockDisplay" class="center"></p> -->
                </div>
            </div>
